There was once a <adj> <singnoun> who <pastverb> in a <singnoun>.
Everyone in the <singnoun> was <adj> of the <adj> <singnoun>,
but no one had the <plunoun> to <pluverb>. So we <adv> <pastverb>
past the <singnoun> and <pastverb> upon the <adj> <plunoun>,
and everyone felt <adj> about their lot in life, until, of course,
the <plunoun> descended upon us like <plunoun> and took <singnoun>
from us. Rue that day! Rue it <adv>.
